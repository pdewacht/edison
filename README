# Per Brinch Hansen's Edison

This repo contains some of my tinkering with Per Brinch Hansen's Edison system, as published in his book _Programming a Personal Computer_.

Hans Otten has a scan of this book and other publications related to Edison [on his site](http://pascal.hansotten.com/per-brinch-hansen/edison-a-multiprocessor-language/). I did not duplicate them here, but you'll want to at least refer to the reports included in the book.

## Edison source code

The [book](/book/) directory contains a transcription of the  book's source code. This includes:

- The Edison kernel slash bytecode interpreter, implemented in the Alva assembly language
- The Edison operating system
- The Edison compiler

Unfortunately, the full Edison distribution seems to be missing.

## PDP-11 disk images

Yes, I got this code running on a simulated PDP-11. It's not useful (there is not even an editor), but it proves that the code works :) The disk images can be downloaded from the Releases tab.

A reimplementation of Alva and a Go port of the compiler can be found in [src/](src/). The port is almost entirely a mechanical transaltion -- the code is not pretty but it works.
